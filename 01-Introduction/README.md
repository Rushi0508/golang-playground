## Introduction

### Why to learn GO Lang?

- Simple, fast and concurrent programming language.
- Strong and statitically typed programming language.
- Developed by Google, so better community support.
- Easy & Straight-forwared learning
> Go = C + Strings + Garbage Collection + Concurrency

### Why Google created GO Lang?

1. **Compile time** issues were faced by google in their larger codebases. So that Go is designed for faster compilation without need for dependency checking.

2. **String Processing**: Google processes and analyzes large amount of text from web pages, which require efficient string manipulation, so Go has comprehensive set of string functions.

3. **Concurrency**: Ability of program to execute multiple tasks independently but not simultaneously. Go has Goroutines which is light-weight thread managed by go runtime.

### Key features of GO Lang.

1. **Concurrency**: Independent tasks; Tasks don't wait for each other to finish before starting their work.

2. **Garbage Collection**: No worry about memory; Automatic Garbage Collection.

3. **Static Typing**: Meaning that variables are explicitly declared with specific type.

4. **Light-wight**: Goroutines take only 8 KB.

5. **Fast Compilation**

6. **Zero Dependencies**: Does not rely on external libraries. So useful for building applications that need to be deployed in varirty of different environments.

7. **Built-in support for testing**

8. **Strong Community Support**

### Companies using GO.

As the popularity increases and companies and people begain to realize the power of Go. It became mainstream language many products.

- Docker & Kubernetes
- CockroachDB & InfluxDB
- Defi platforms like **Ethereum**
- Istio
- Drone
- NATS
- Cobra
- and many more...
