## Introduction

### Why to learn GO Lang?

- Simple, fast and concurrent programming language.
- Strong and statitically typed programming language.
- Developed by Google, so better community support.
- Easy & Straight-forwared learning: Go = C + Strings + Garbage Collection + Concurrency

### Why Google created GO Lang?

1. Compile time issues were faced by google in their larger codebases. So that Go is designed for faster compilation without need for dependency checking.

2. String Processing: Google processes and analyzes large amount of text from web pages, which require efficient string manipulation, so Go has comprehensive set of string functions.

3. Concurrency: Ability of program to execute multiple tasks independently but not simultaneously. Go has Goroutines which is light-weight thread managed by go runtime.
